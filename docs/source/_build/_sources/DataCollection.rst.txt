Data Collection
======================
Novaland enables the collection of diverse participant behavior data through an online process.
Just follow a few steps to gather the information.

Upload your project on Heroku
================================
The goal is to deliver the new version of Novaland on the existing server.
The Project is already available on the Heroku Server.

oTree Hub
==================================
There are several ways to upload the project to Heroku. The easiest way is to use "oTreeHub".
oTreehub is a project management tool aimed at simplifying and speeding up the development process of oTree-based studies.

If you don't have a Heroku account or your account is not connected to otreeHub.
Then this must be done before you can upload your project to Heroku using oTreehub.

Upload your project on oTreeHub:
________________________________

    1. Open your project in PyCharm.
    2. Go to the Terminal windows and write:

    .. code-block:: console

        otree zip

    3. PyCharm generates an oTree.zip file for you, located at the project's location.

    4. Open your browser and go to this page:

    .. code-block:: console

        www.otreehub.com

    5. Login or create an account on oTreehub.

    6. Click on "Heroku" in the menu.
    7. Select your project and press the 'Deploy' Button.
    8. Upload your oTree.zip file on the 'Upload code to Heroku' section.

    The Project is now Online in your Heroku account.

Data collection on Heroku
=========================

Create a new session
________________________
To get an overview of the functions of Heroku, you can open the chapter 'Heroku'.

    1. Open your browser and go to:

    .. code-block:: console

        www.heroku.com

    2. Create an account or login to your account.
    3. The first site that you can see is a overview about your projects.
    4. Select your Novaland Project.


Different sessions can be created via the Session window.
These sessions are separated from each other.
Various settings can be made, such as the number of participants.
Individual settings defined in the settings.py file also play a role in this, and they can be further modified in the session settings.

Sending Links to the participant
______________________________________
A session generates links for participants that can be sent to them.
When the participants open the link, they can participate in the project or study.
- Jakob Explanation needed about sending the links to the participants -

Monitoring the session
=======================

When you are inside the session, you can view various features that allow you to observe the activities of participants.
These are displayed at the top of the session, and below are listed some of the key functions:

Monitor
_________________
The 'Monitor' window displays real-time metrics such as the number of dynos running, the amount of CPU and memory being used, and the number of requests being processed.
It also provides alerts if there are any issues or errors with your application.

Data
___________________
The 'Data' window, on the other hand, provides insights into the data being generated by your application.
This includes logs, metrics, and events, which can be used to analyze and optimize the performance of your application.
You can also use this data to troubleshoot any issues that may arise.
The 'Player' model's variables are also displayed here.
This is useful for verifying that all variables are being stored correctly.

Close Session
===================
To prevent participants from influencing the study hours after their participation, you can close the session.
Here are the steps to follow:

    1. Click on 'Sessions' in the top bar
    2. Click on the code of the active session that you want to close
    3. You will see a section with the text 'This session is taking place in the room Novaland.' Click on 'Novaland'
    4. You will now see a button labeled 'Close this room' next to the 'Go to active session' section
    5. Press this button to end the session.

Download Datas of the participants
=========================================
The participant data and page times can be downloaded in a separate window called 'Data', located at the top of the oTree bar.
This window provides access to CSV files containing all the collected information from all the apps.
You can download data from all apps at once or select specific apps to download data from.

At the bottom of the window, there is also a download button for all page times, which enables you to see how long a participant spent on each page.
