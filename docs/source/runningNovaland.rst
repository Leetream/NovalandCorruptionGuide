Running Novaland
======================

To test the 'Novaland' project, a local page can be created using a command that includes the project.
Follow these steps to run the Novaland project on your computer using PyCharm:

    1. Open your project in PyCharm
    2. Use the 'cd' command in the terminal to navigate to your project folder
    3. Type 'otree devserver' in the terminal.
    4. A link to a local page where you can access your project will appear, typically 'http://localhost:8000/'.

To be able to test the project with multiple participants, the project needs to be uploaded to :ref:`heroku-page`.

Monitoring
______________________________
Monitoring of participants in an oTree app enables researchers or experimenters to track the actions and decisions of participants in real-time.
This is particularly useful to ensure that the study is being conducted as planned and to quickly identify any issues or errors.
The monitoring tool in oTree allows researchers to track the progress of participants, see which decisions they have made, and how much time they have spent on each task.
Additionally, researchers can also access the data generated by participants for later analysis.
