Novaland
======================

Novaland is a political behavior game that immerses participants in a fictional state for several months.
Participants are assigned different values, such as income, which influence their decision-making within the game.
They decide how to live in Novaland with their money and how much to save at the end of each month.
Various randomly assigned events, such as a forest fire or sudden unemployment, impact the gaming experience for everyone involved.
The highlight of the Novaland study is an event where participants can choose one of four parties that best reflects their interests in Novaland.
Novaland is not played all at once; rather, individual phases are only accessible during specific time periods on the day of the study.
Finally, at the conclusion of the study, a survey is conducted to assess the reasons behind their decisions throughout the game.

There are various randomized events in Novaland that can affect gameplay.

Different Phases
======================

Novaland is divided into 5 phases, which are unlocked for participants at a certain time of day during the study. Each phase represents one month in Novaland.
The first three phases can be played consecutively by participants, as they serve as an introduction to Novaland.
During these phases, income is assigned, participants are asked about lifestyle decisions that have an impact on the available funds, and participants may be affected by corruption or unemployment.
They also have the option to choose one of four parties.

In the fourth phase, the election results are announced, and changes to the income of participants are based on the outcome.
Additionally, a wildfire occurs during this phase, and participants can donate to those affected.

In the fifth phase, it is announced who has been affected by the fire, and they receive their share of the donation but also lose a large portion of their savings.
Another call for donations is made to gauge the willingness of donors to contribute.
