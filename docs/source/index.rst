Novaland Guide
=========================================

The Novaland Guide is the documentation of the political behavior game 'Novaland'.
This was created by the team of Achim Goerres at the University of Duisburg-Essen as part of the ERC-funded project "POLITSOLID" .

The entire project was written and programmed using oTree.
oTree  provides a framework for building and running online experiments, allowing researchers to easily create custom games and surveys, manage participants, and collect and analyze data.
An oTree project consists of a set of components, such as Python scripts, HTML templates and models, which work together to define the structure and behavior of the experiment.

Novaland is designed to be highly customizable, allowing researchers to create experiments that meet their specific needs, and to easily integrate with other tools for data analysis and management.
